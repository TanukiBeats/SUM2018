Checking for the presence of the requisite programs in the path.
G09 found.
Antechamber found.
Tleap found.
Parmchk found.
Assuming awk present.
Assuming sed present.
Old version of ambertools detected. This still works, but the Gaussian calculation will be restricted to 1 core and 512MB of memory.
Test Passed!!!


Starting ffmaker using the following inputs:

###ALL COMMANDS ARE CASE SENSITIVE. SEE EXAMPLES###

###STANDARD INPUTS###
RESIDUE_NAME=BMI    #three characters, letters should be caps. example: BMI, 1EM, P00
INPUT_TYPE=pdb      #com (recommended), pdb (also a good choice), mol2
CHARGE=-1            #1,-1, or 0 usually
SCALED=yes           #Do you want to scale the charges? (yes, no)
FACTOR=0.8            #Scaling factor.

###CONDITIONAL INPUTS###
REPLACE_HF=no       #You can replace hartee fock with a different method. no (default), b3lyp, mp2
#REPLACE_631=no     #You can replace 6-31G* with a different basis set. no (default), 3-21G, 6-311G*. not currently working.
METHOD=resp         #resp (recommended), esp, bcc
G09_MEM="%mem=1000MB"   #Gaussian memory
G09_PROC="%nproc=16"   #Gaussian processors
REPLACE_FF=no       #Change force field to something other than amber99sb-ildn. no (default), ff99sb


======== PREPARATION ========

Checking for input file...
File found. Continuing as planned...
Initiating antechamber converstion of .pdb to .com with proper headers.


======== PREPARATION COMPLETE ========

======== GAUSSIAN ========

Checking for previously running Gaussian jobs...
No Gaussian jobs found. Continuing as planned...

Initiating Gaussian calculation...
This step may take several minutes depending on the size of your molecule.
TIP: If you ctrl+c this script, g09 will continue to run in the background.
To kill the background job try this command:
kill -9 `ps aux | grep g09 | grep BMI | awk {'print $2'}`


Time elapsed: 0 seconds
WARNING: Gaussian job may have failed to start or was unusually short. Script will continue.
WARNING: Normal termination of Gaussian job NOT detected. Exiting.

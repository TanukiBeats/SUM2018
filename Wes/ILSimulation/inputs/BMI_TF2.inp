#SIMULATIONS CONTAINING SOLUTE(S).
SOLVENT_TYPE=IL      #Type of solvent. (IL (ionic liquid), organic, DES (deep eutectic), water, none)
SOLUTE=start          #pdb of the solute. Protein is the only supported solute now. Should be a pdb.
		      #set PERCENT 
		      #>>You can do a binary mixture of the solvent with water by setting the $PERCENT variable to >0 <<#
		      #>>If you want multiple solutes in one simulation, they can be input as a single pdb file containing all of the molecules.

#SIMULATIONS CONTAINING NO SOLUTE(S)
SOLVENT_BOX=yes       #Do you want to do a simulation of pure solvent? (yes, no) This will override $SOLUTE above.

#GENERAL PARAMETERS. TRY YOUR BEST TO FILL OUT ALL VARIABLES.
IL_CAT=BMI           #Resname of IL cation and all associated files
IL_AN=TF2            #Resname of IL anion and all associated files
ORG_MOL=None          #Resname of the organic solvent or h-bond donating molecule. (Leave blank if not organic or DES)
MOLM=419.355           #Molar mass of the organic molecule or IL pair in amu

DENS=0.9             #organic molecule, DES, or IL in g/cm^3. Guess 1 if unknown
PERC_TYPE=mole        #For binary mixtures. Which type of % do you want? (mass, mole, volume) vol may not be supported for DES
PERCENT=100         #Percent of solvent you wish to be IL (in DES and IL) or organic (in organic).
		      #(20 = 20% w/w or 20% v/v or 20 mol% for example). A solvent box with no water is the integer 100.

BUFFER=12.5           #Space between the solue and the edge of the box in Angstroms.
CUBIC=iso             #iso = cubic, leaving it blank will create a rectangular prism.
GROMACS=yes           #Generate .gro and .top files using acpype.py? (yes, no)
NEUTRALIZE=no         #Neutralize the charge by adding counterions Na+ or Cl-. (yes, no)
DISULFIDE=no          #Are there disulfide bonds in the solute. (yes, no). Works for proteins.
SSBOND_A_1=100        #You must manually input all disulfide bonds with a line for each atom. SSBOND_B_1=120
SSBOND_A_2=25         #(SSBOND_A_#=RESIDUE_NUM, SSBOND_B_#=RESIDUE_NUM). This means that the #th SSBOND is between RESIDUE_NUM and $RESIDUE_NUM.

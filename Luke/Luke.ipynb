    "1. What's even the end goal here which will help with the SEI layer problem? O_O Checking the reaction intermediate structures? Getting energy values? Checking to see what happens when I throw in new things like more electrons?\n",
    "2. What's up with the radical ion? Unless I'm going crazy it seems really important to this paper but not so much to the other paper... Is this radical ion termination the last step or something? I'll have to check the diagrams.\n",
    "3. What kind of solvent model am I using? I feel like I heard Luke say something about using a explicit model? The paper seems to use both and compare the results.\n",
    "4. Is \"absolute data\" the absolute value of the dataset?\n",
    "5. What's the benefit to using these so-called \"supermolecules\"?"

    "Question for Luke:\n",
    "1. How much does it matter which version of Gaussian I'm using? o_o\n",
    "2. Am I starting from scratch and just runnign the simulation to see which one I get and which one in the papers it's closest? Or I'm setting up certain systems and seeing how energetically favorable they are?\n",
    "3. Hybrid functionals seem to be favored in these papers? Am I going to try out different functionals and basis sets?\n",
    "4. How are hybrid functional theories alleviating local self-interaction errors? What are those errors anyways?\n",
    "5. I'm still not clear on the necessity of the simulations where there are an extra electron vs. the ones where there is a Li+ ion. They're both single ions and I'm not entirely clear on the different effects that each one is having.\n",
    "6. When they use the terminology that a function \"predicts\" a structure, is that referring to what actually comes out of the simulation?\n",
    "7. Short description on why HOMO and LUMO are so important? I've heard of them before.\n",
    "8. What does it mean when they're injecting an electron? It isn't there at the start of the simulation?\n",
    "9. What's screening?\n",
    "10. What's the point of doing simulations with one vs. two excess electrons? Isn't that a little too specific considered that in reality there will be way more electrons? Unless we are talking a specific 1:1 vs. 2:1 ratio."
